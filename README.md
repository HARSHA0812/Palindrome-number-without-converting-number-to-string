# Palindrome-number-without-converting-number-to-string
Python code for finding if an number is palindrome without converting it to string

## Problem Statement
Given an integer x, return true if x is palindrome integer.
An integer is a palindrome when it reads the same backward as forward.<br>
For example, 121 is a palindrome while 123 is not.<br>
 

Example 1:<br>
Input: x = 121<br>
Output: true

Explanation: 121 reads as 121 from left to right and from right to left.


Example 2:<br>
Input: x = -121<br>
Output: false<br>

Explanation: From left to right, it reads -121. From right to left, it becomes 121-. Therefore it is not a palindrome.
